<h1>About Me</h1>
</div>
<p>Hi! My name is Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert and this is my personal website and blog. As far back as I can remember, I've always been fascinated by technology and machines. I hold a PhD in compiler design, which is my main area of expertise, but I have a fairly wide range of interests. I've dabbled with many things over the years including 3D graphics, game engine design, music, sound synthesis, virtual machine design, programming language design, reinforcement learning, imitation learning, robotics, microcontrollers, and electronics.</p>
<p>Research and development is the kind of work I was born for. I thrive in an environment where creative thinking, exploration of new ideas and problem solving is possible. After my PhD, I briefly worked as part of the Apple GPU compiler team, where I gained experience with GPU architectures and LLVM internals. Following this, I joined the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (Mila), an academic AI research institute where I worked on various reinforcement learning and deep learning research projects with Yoshua Bengio, Liam Paull, Doina Precup and many graduate students. The work I produced at Mila is cited in over 1200 AI papers.</p>
<p>In 2020, I joined Shopify, where I started a team to build <a href="https://shopify.engineering/ruby-yjit-is-production-ready">YJIT</a>, a new JIT compiler for CRuby. YJIT is now the official CRuby JIT compiler, it has transformed the Ruby performance landscape, and it has been deployed at Shopify, GitHub, Stripe, Strava, ZenDesk, Discourse, lobste.rs, and mastodon.social among others. There's a pretty good chance you've browsed a website or used an app that is powered by YJIT today.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I like to blog and work on various open-source projects among other things. You can find my open-source projects on <a href="https://github.com/maximecb/">GitHub</a> and my publications on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lSg6I8gAAAAJ">Google Scholar</a>. If you want to reach out, you can contact me via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximecb/">LinkedIn</a> or on x.com where my handle is <a href="https://x.com/Love2Code">@Love2Code</a>. You can also subscribe to this blog via the <a href="/feed.xml">RSS feed</a>.</p>
