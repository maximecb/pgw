<h1>Basic Block Versioning - Published At Last!</h1>
<div class="post_date">March 18th, 2015</div>
</div>
<p>Over a month ago, I received reviews for the basic block versioning paper I submitted to ECOOP 2015. The reviews were again mixed, ranging from great to terrible. After <a href="/2014/11/10/pushing-higgs-to-the-limit/">3 previous rejections</a> at <a href="/2014/07/17/my-paper-was-rejected-again/">other conferences</a>, I'd lowered my expectations and thought we were most likely in for a fourth refusal. To be honest, I was somewhat angry. The worst review we had received was unfair and harsh. Whoever had written it seemed to have a fairly poor understanding of JIT compilation, but that didn't stop them from aggressively criticizing our work.</p>
<p>Fortunately for me, ECOOP offers a chance for submitters to <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/peer-review-rebuttals/">respond to peer reviews</a>, and I was able to channel my anger into motivation to write a very strong and detailed rebuttal. I still didn't think our paper would make it, but at the very least, I thought, I gave it my all. I was pleasantly surprised when I learned earlier this month that <a href="http://2015.ecoop.org/event/research-track-simple-and-effective-type-check-removal-through-lazy-basic-block-versioning">the paper was accepted!</a> Two reviewers increased the score they gave us, tipping the balance in our favor.</p>
<p>This is an important turning point for me, because it means the key contribution of my research work (the idea of <a href="/2013/12/10/the-incremental-jit-lives/">basic block versioning</a>) is getting published. I'm finally getting some official recognition from my academic peers for the past four years of hard work I poured into my research. Getting at least one publication from my PhD work was a personal goal I'd set for myself.</p>
<p>Now that this goal is reached, this paper offers me something to build upon. Publishing about <a href="/2015/02/08/my-thesis-a-clearer-picture/">additional contributions</a> from my PhD work should be a fair bit easier now that I have my foot in the academic door. I'm already working on a new paper about typed object shapes, and I'll be able to cite the ECOOP paper. I'll be able to present further contributions as improvements over the work I already published, instead of trying to explain them in isolation.</p>
<p>And hey, I get to go give a talk in Prague! Sometimes I think being an academic isn't all that bad.</p>
