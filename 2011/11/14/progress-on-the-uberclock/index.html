<p>In the last few weeks I've been slowly but steadily advancing on my <a href="/2011/10/04/toying-with-avr-microcontrollers/">überclock project</a>. Having a limited amount of spare time, I decided to target simpler intermediate goals for my project. I have a million ideas for possible features I could add to the alarm clock, but I figure it's best to start by implementing a simple, complete, working alarm clock, and later add extra devices to it in a modular fashion. My current plan is to build a black box with configuration buttons, an LCD screen and a little speaker to act as the alarm clock, with an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmel_AVR">AVR microcontroller</a> for brains.</p>

<p>Once I have the simple clock working nicely, I'm thinking I could add infrared emitters to it so that I can have it wirelessly control other devices, such as a large time display panel (a <a href="http://evilmadscience.com/productsmenu/partsmenu/107-sevensegment">giant 7-segment display</a>), and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise_machine">white noise machine</a> to help me sleep. One advantage is that this will help me avoid getting discouraging by a project of ever-increasing scope that never gets finished (I should actually be able to finish the first step pretty soon!). Another is that with a modular system, if one part breaks, the rest of the system can potentially continue functioning normally, and the broken part can more easily be fixed.</p>
<p>I also decided to build my simple alarm clock itself using a modular design. I've been soldering individual modules on small prototype boards with molex connectors. For example, I've assembled a DS1307 Real-Time Clock (RTC) module with a battery backup, an input module (using a 74HC165 shift register), as well as some pushbuttons and a speakers with molex connectors:</p>

<p>Once I complete a power supply module, a few extra pushbuttons with connectors and a main board for the microcontroller, the alarm clock will essentially be complete as far as the hardware goes. The modular design has been particularly advantageous so far because it means I can build and test small components one at a time. If a component is faulty, the problem is easier to track down than if the whole clock was built at once on a large board. I should also say that while my soldering skills have much improved in the last two weeks, I still want to avoid a situation where I would have to painstakingly backtrack out of a soldering mistake.</p>
<p>Before I permanently assemble components with solder and hot glue, I try to prototype everything on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadboard">breadboard</a> so that I can be sure the final circuit will work properly. One issue I've had is that I often want to use a multimeter to get voltage and current readings, but it's hard to do this reliably with standard multimeter leads. The solution I found was to buy a cheap multimeter on ebay (<a href="http://www.ebay.ca/itm/New-LCD-Digital-Multimeter-DT830B-not-include-battery-/220628109061#ht_3025wt_1165">less than $3 USD shipped</a>, without the 9V battery) and modify the leads so that they can directly connect into the breadboard. I cut off the multimeter leads, soldered some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin">sowing pins</a> at the ends of the wires instead, and wrapped the connection with shrink wrap. I've been very pleased with the result.</p>

<p>One last thing I'd like to mention is that I found some great online supplier for electronic parts. <a href="http://www.taydaelectronics.com/">Tayda Electronics</a> is a store from Thailand which has some pretty amazing prices (2 cents for DIP8 sockets, as low as 4 cents for pushbuttons, etc.) and a very broad inventory. The shipping takes a while (around 3 weeks) but the deals are definitely worth it, especially if you want to stock up on some components. If I need to get some fairly common component quickly, I tend to order from Dipmicro Electronics. They're a Canadian (Ontario-based) store with pretty good prices, sometimes even better than Asian sellers.</p>
