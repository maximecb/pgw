<h1>Silicon Valley, Six Months Later</h1>
<div class="post_date">September 21st, 2016</div>
</div>
<p>Maybe you've been wondering why I haven't posted on this blog in over four months. The main reason is that my energy has been going elsewhere. In February, I defended my PhD thesis and relocated to the South San Francisco Bay area (aka Silicon Valley) to work in tech. Most of my energy, since then, has been spent adapting to a new job and settling into a new environment. To be completely honest, it's been difficult. I defended my thesis, prepared for an international move and started a new job all within one month. Hindsight is 20/20: if I had to do it over, I would take two or three months off after completing my degree to give myself a buffer to complete this transition.</p>
<p>Six months later, I have mixed feelings. I'm not sure how I feel about Silicon Valley. I picked an apartment in the South SF Bay because I wanted to be close to work. I'm able to bike to work, which is nice. However, as someone who grew up and lived all her life in a big city, the area feels very suburban and well, boring, to me. In all likelihood, part of the problem is that I don't have many friends here. Once the work day is over, I often feel very lonely. It might sound cheesy, but this is probably what I regret most about leaving my hometown: leaving my friends and family behind.</p>
<p>I try to look at the bright side: I'm happy with my job. I like my boss and my coworkers. People here work reasonable hours and the work is challenging. I have my own place for the first time in my life. It's a big apartment in a quiet neighborhood, it's a comfortable place to live. Silicon Valley is a huge tech hub. It's a good opportunity for me to learn a lot. Because I don't go out much these days, I've actually made a decent amount of progress on my programming language project in my spare time. I also installed an electric motor on my bike and completed some electronic projects. These things give me some satisfaction. Still, loneliness is hard, and I don't quite feel at home here yet.</p>
