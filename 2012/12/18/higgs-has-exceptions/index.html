<h1>Higgs has Exceptions</h1>
<div class="post_date">December 18th, 2012</div>
</div>
<p>I just finished implementing exceptions in the <a href="/2012/12/08/higgs-my-new-tracing-jit-for-javascript/">Higgs</a> interpreter, complete with support for the <code>finally</code> block and optional <code>catch</code> clauses. The fact that Higgs is an interpreter and tracing JIT instead of a method-based compiler definitely made this process somewhat simpler. The interpreter uses a calling convention where all arguments are pushed on the stack and each stack frame has a fixed size, making stack unwinding very easy. The tracing JIT won't have to do any special treatment of exceptions: it will simply fall back to the interpreter.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, one of the trickiest aspects of exception support is the <code>finally</code> block. This was difficult to implement because the semantics of JavaScript (and Java) say that every form of control flow leaving a <code>try</code> or <code>catch</code> block must execute the corresponding <code>finally</code> blocks (and there might be more than one). This means the throw, break, continue and return statements can each trigger the execution of <code>finally</code> blocks. You can hijack a return statement using a <code>finally</code> block and return a different value. Worse yet: exceptions crossing interprocedural boundaries can trigger the execution of <code>finally</code> blocks while unwinding the stack.</p>
<p>Since my interpreter uses an intermediate representation built on basic blocks and sequences of instructions, I had to compile <code>finally</code> blocks in-line at every point where they would be run, which meant handling a multitude of corner cases. I believe this complexity reveals that <code>finally</code> blocks are a fundamentally "unnatural" language feature. I say unnatural because the control flow involved is convoluted and unintuitive to programmers. Preventing a return statement from executing seems like the kind of black magic that simply shouldn't be possible.</p>
<p>I'm quite happy to have exception support as I believe it will make debugging the Higgs runtime and standard libraries (both written in extended JS) much easier. Now that this is done, I will be moving towards one of the biggest pieces of the puzzle: implementing a garbage collector for Higgs. Since the focus of my research isn't garbage collection, I will implement a simple and minimalist stop-the-world copying GC. Having previously implemented a <a href="/2012/01/12/about-tachyons-garbage-collector/">similar GC</a> for Tachyon, I anticipate that I should be able to complete this task within approximately two weeks. The task will be sped up by the automatic generation of code to visit heap-allocated objects.</p>
<p>In case anyone reading this blog is interested, I could use some help on various fronts, one of which is the completion of the <a href="https://github.com/maximecb/Higgs/blob/master/source/stdlib/math.js">math library</a>. I'm missing functions such as <code>Math.ceil</code>, <code>Math.log</code>,<code>Math.exp</code> and full floating-point support in <code>Math.pow</code>. I'm also in need of code to parse and format floating-point values as strings. All of this code would be written in JavaScript. Lastly, I'm looking for a simple JavaScript FFT (fourier transform) benchmark.</p>
